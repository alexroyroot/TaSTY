\description{
  ~~ The function takes several inputs: (1) a table to paths from receptors to transcription factors;
 (2) a table of transcription factors and their target genes
 (3) experimental data of phosphoproteomics ratios between 2 experimental conditions ~~
 (4) experimental data of proteomics ratios between 2 experimental conditions
 (5) experimental data of transcriptomics ratios between 2 experimental conditions
